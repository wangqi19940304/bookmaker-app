# Development process description

## AI tool usage
1. **UI design**: Use MidJourney to generate a responsive table layout prototype
2. **Code generation**: Generate Annotations with the help of VSCode Copilot

## Key decision points
1. Use Ant Design tables: Comes with Table/Modal Components to reduce reinvention
2. Combined filtering implementation: Use useMemo to achieve high-performance filtering and avoid unnecessary rendering
